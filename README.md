The motive of this project is to recognize a face from a given set of images or frames, and identify it based on the emotion that the face is showing. 

The *main.py* file is the code for performing Face Emotion Recognition on a live feed of camera.

The *classifier.ipynb* file is the code for the classifier, showing output for an image.

The *model.h5* file is the model that is used as classifier, and is created in *classifier.ipynb* file
